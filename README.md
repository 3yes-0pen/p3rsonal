Code in my personal projects

Currently, this is a place for RAW PROJECT CODE
I am putting every single project I do here. We all start from 0 and so I want to reflect my journey this way.

I suggest my Tableau visualizations: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicholas.ramirez/vizzes

or my Kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasramirez/code

in order to understand what I was seeking through this project more specifically.
